## 🧩 Problem Statement

**AirPure Innovations** is a startup tackling India's growing air pollution crisis. With uncertainty around product features, target markets, and consumer demand, the company needed insights to guide strategic decisions.

Key questions addressed:
- Which pollutants should the product focus on (PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, etc.)?
- Which cities show the highest demand for air purifiers?
- How do health impacts due to poor air quality vary across cities?
- How do competing products compare on features?

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The dashboard is structured into multiple analytical pages:

1. **Executive Overview** – A one-page summary for decision-makers  
2. **Severity Mapping** – AQI severity by city  
3. **Health Impact** – AQI-related disease burden by age group  
4. **Vehicle Emission Insights** – Impact of vehicular emissions  
5. **Market Demand** – Google Trends + population density  
6. **Competitor Analysis** – Feature gap matrix across existing brands

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

This project helped me grow tremendously as a data analyst. Before this challenge, I had no hands-on experience with real business problems. Through this challenge, I learned how to approach a business case, derive insights from raw data, and present them in a meaningful and visual format that speaks to stakeholders.

The most valuable skill I gained?  
**Data Storytelling** — making data speak and drive decisions.
